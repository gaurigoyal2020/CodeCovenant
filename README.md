# 🧿 CodeCovenant

*A daily pact with logic — forged in loops, sealed with semicolons. Here lies the covenant: one problem a day, each a step closer to mastery.*

This is my space to log the battles I fight and win with data structures and algorithms.  
Each problem is a ritual. Each solution, a sigil.  
In this house we don't just grind, we grow~

## 🔮 Covenant Status
- ⏳ One problem a day
- 🧠 Priority: Pattern recognition over perfection

> *May the sacred stack trace reveal solutions, not suffering.*
